Currently, I am focused in finished the following issues before releasing version 0.1

- add client side prediction
- server side collision detection might be not working as expected
- better networking
- cleaning up the game API
- think of a game name

I have other ideas with what to improve the game, but I'll focus on them after I finish these objectives. If you have the knowledge and want to help me, you can focus on these problems, or you can do any of these that I'm not paying attention yet:

- extend tilesets and create new maps (if you are a pixel artist of level designer, it may be a good experience :))
- add some music and SFX
- create in game menus (I think of using impress.js for that)
- login via twitter/facebook
- only use connect instead of express for serving static files

Of course, you will be added to the list of contributors if you help. If you have some ideas or problems, please email me at nvl.bg.rules@gmail.com
